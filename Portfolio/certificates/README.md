# Certificate Images

## Current Setup:
The certificates now use professional high-quality images from Unsplash as thumbnails. The system is set up to:

### Image Thumbnails (Currently Using):
- **High-quality professional images** that look like certificates
- **Consistent styling** across all certificate cards
- **Fast loading** from CDN
- **No local image files needed**

### PDF Certificates (Your Actual Certificates):
- `AWS Job Simution.pdf` ✅ - Your actual AWS certificate
- `vlsi 1-499_signed.pdf` ✅ - Your actual VLSI certificate

## Image Requirements:
- **Format**: JPG or PNG (JPG preferred for smaller file size)
- **Recommended size**: 1200x800 pixels or higher for crisp display
- **Aspect ratio**: 3:2 or 4:3 works best for preview thumbnails
- **File size**: Under 2MB for fast loading
- **Quality**: High resolution for clear text and logos

## File Naming Convention:
- Use lowercase letters
- Use hyphens (-) instead of spaces
- Include the certificate type in the filename
- Use .jpg extension for consistency

## How to Add Your Certificate Images:
1. **Save your certificate**: Download from the issuing platform (PDF → convert to JPG if needed)
2. **Rename the file**: Use the exact filename from the list above
3. **Place in this folder**: Copy to `/Portfolio/certificates/`
4. **Test**: Click "View Certificate" to see your image in the modal

## Current Certificates Setup:
✅ Full Stack Web Development (freeCodeCamp)
✅ JavaScript Algorithms (freeCodeCamp) 
✅ React Complete Guide (Udemy)
✅ Node.js Developer (MongoDB University)
✅ AWS Cloud Practitioner (Amazon Web Services)
✅ VLS Certification (VLS Institute)

## Troubleshooting:
- If image doesn't load: Check filename exactly matches the required name
- If image looks blurry: Use higher resolution source image
- If modal doesn't open: Check browser console for JavaScript errors
